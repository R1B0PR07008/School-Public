            <br><span class="tittle">Why are GMOs allowed/not allowed?</span>
            <br> &emsp; <span class="sub-tittle">EU and US:</span>
            <br> &emsp; &emsp; In The EU the health risks are considered to outweigh the economical advantages/Agricultural benefits. Added to that is limited trust on the institutions and firms involved.   <span class="citation">(BIP - Why Are Most Europeans Opposed to GMOs? - Factors Explaining Rejection in France and Europe, n.d.) (Sohi et al., 2023)</span>
            <span class="note">Do note that the US has a much more positive attitude towards GMOs.</span>
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            <span class="tittle">Should GMO products be labeled? why?</span>
            <br> &emsp;<span class="sub-tittle">US:</span>
            <br> &emsp; &emsp;   In the US certain types of GMOs have to be labeled. They are any and all foods that humans eat that have been genetically modified in ways that can not be replicated through conventional breeding.
            <br> &emsp;<span class="sub-tittle">EU:</span>
            <br> &emsp; &emsp;  Any food that is more than 0.9% genetically modified food has to be labeled in the EU. <span class="citation">(Traceability and Labelling, n.d.)</span>
            <br> &emsp;<span class="sub-tittle">CR:</span>
            <br> &emsp; &emsp;  It is written in the Political Constitution of Costa Rica that “Los consumidores y usuarios tienen derecho a la protección de su salud, ambiente, seguridad e intereses económicos; a recibir información adecuada y veraz; a la libertad de elección, y a un trato equitativo. El Estado apoyará los organismos que ellos constituyan para la defensa de sus derechos. La ley regulará esas materias.” <span class="citation">(S-COM: Davinsson Nunjar Flores, n.d.)</span> Thus, since it is a constitutional right of the citizen of Costa Rica to know what they are eating, all GMOs in CR should be appropriately labeled.
            <br> &emsp; <span class="sub-tittle">Our Opinion</span>
            <br> &emsp; &emsp; GMO Product should definitely be labeled. The user has the right, at least here in Costa Rica they do, to know what they are eating and where it came from. 
        <br><br>
        <p>
            <span class="tittle">Should some GMOs be allowed but not others? </span>
            <br> &emsp; No, not all GMOs should be allowed. GMOs that are bad, or have the capability to harm humans or animals in any way, shape, or form shouldn't be allowed. But GMOs that have the capability of making our proceses more efficient, or GMOs that can save the world should definitely be allowed.

            <span class="tittle">Are GMOs a viable solution to World Hunger?</span>
            <br> &emsp; <span class="sub-tittle">Arguments in support:</span>
            <br> &emsp; &emsp;  1. Higher Crop Yield: By engineering GMOs to produce more, more food may be produced on the same area of land. This might assist in addressing the rising food demand brought on by population expansion.
            <br> Enhanced Nutrient Content: Through genetic modification, crops can have a higher nutritional content, giving populations vital vitamins and minerals that their diets may be deficient in.
            <br> &emsp; <span class="sub-tittle">Arguments against it:</span>
            <br> &emsp; &emsp;  1. Environmental worries: There are concerns regarding the potential problems of GMOs on the world, including the increase of resistance and the unanticipated effects of genetic manipulation.
            <br> &emsp; &emsp;  2. Health Risks: Some individuals are worried about how eating GMOs may affect their health in the long run. GMOs have been shown safe in most scientific investigations, although distrust persists and additional study is still needed.

        <p>
            <span class="tittle">Should GMOs and their genetic traits be licensed? </span> 
            <br> &emsp; It all depends on the society you live in. In a capitalist society, *yes you should be able to license it; UNLESS it is a world saving invention, of course, in that case it should be public information for eny one to access. But in a Socialist society, companies and researchers will undoubtedly have to share some of their product as to create a socialized production for the whole country. Though of course we are biased since we have been raised in a capitalist society.

            <span class="tittle">What are some ethical considerations regarding GMOs?</span>
            <br> &emsp; <span class="sub-tittle">Effect on the Environment:</span>
            <br> &emsp; &emsp;Biodiversity: <span class="tini-letter">There are concerns that GMOs can affect biodiversity unintentionally. Genetically modified crops have the potential to cause an imbalance in the ecosystem or drive out native species.</span>
            <br> &emsp; &emsp;Gene Flow: <span class="tini-letter">Concerns about unprecedented repercussions and the potential for superweeds or superbugs are raised by the idea of GMO genes passing into wild or non-GMO crops.</span>
            <br> &emsp; <span class="sub-tittle">Human Well-Being:</span>
            <br> &emsp; &emsp;Allergenicity: <span class="tini-letter">Concerns have been raised over the possibility that genetic engineering could add new allergens to food, which could have an impact on alergic people.</span>
            <br> &emsp; &emsp;Toxicity: <span class="tini-letter">There's a worry that eating GMOs could have unintentional negative impacts on the health of the consumer.</span>

            <span class="tittle">What are GMOs?</span>
            <br> &emsp; GMOs are Genetic modified organisms, which mean that they are living entities with DNA that has been changed in a way that does not occur normally within the species. The method of producing genetically modified organisms (GMOs) requires modifying an organism's DNA in a lab to produce the wanted modifications. GMOs are commonly developed in agriculture and food to raise crop surplus, boost resistance, improve the product’s nutritional value, or make the harvest more resilient to the environment. To quote: “recently developed and newly emerging genetic manipulation technologies, such as recombinant DNA (rDNA), recombinant RNA (rRNA) and cell fusion, that are sometimes referred to as genetic engineering.” <span class="citation">(Executive Office of the President & Office of Science and Technology Policy, 1986)</span>
